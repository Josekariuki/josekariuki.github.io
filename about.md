## About

Hi, I’m Joseph Kariuki!
I’m a passionate data enthusiast with a background in Clinical Medicine and Community Health. My journey began in healthcare, where I realized the immense potential of data to drive impactful solutions. This led me to pivot into data science, a field where I could combine my medical expertise with analytical tools to solve real-world challenges.

Currently, I’m working on projects that explore the intersection of AI and healthcare, such as using machine learning to improve diagnostic accuracy and analyzing mental health trends to inform public health policies. I’m also expanding my technical skills, including Python, data visualization, and machine learning frameworks, to better serve these goals.

My ultimate aspiration is to bridge the gap between data and impact, using insights to create transformative change in healthcare, finance, and beyond.
